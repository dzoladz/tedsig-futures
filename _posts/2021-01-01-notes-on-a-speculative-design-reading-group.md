*In 2019 Renee Albrecht-Mallinger and I started a reading group at Chicago's
community lab [LATITUDE](https://www.latitudechicago.org/) called "Design After
the End of the World". We talk about speculative design, climate change, and
current events with artists, designers and others. We have had two iterations
of the group so far. Each met for eight weekly sessions in the early fall and
each had a different group of participants.*

*Speculative design gives me chances to think about diversity, of ideas and
people, in design. In a reading group participants compare their responses to a
work with one another; I think these groups make sense for speculative design
because it can be about exploring how different kinds of futures might affect
different people. I think it's important to do this because the benefits and
harms of particular futures will always be distributed unevenly.*

## Speculative design, climate, and "problem solving"

Discussions about "what is the difference between art and design?" might seem a
little annoying and self-important to outsiders&mdash;but I think in the
context of a reading group for artists and designers they're good discussions
to have, if for no other reason than everyone needs to figure out how to earn a
living.

I tend to think that the differences have something to do with who the client
is (an art buyer or a company), what the work is supposed to do (be expressive
or solve a problem) and where the work ends up (in an art gallery or maybe a
retail store) but that is probably a little simplistic. When this topic has
come up in our group people brought up lots of examples where artists and
designers did things that made the two categories blurry. I do think the
differences between the two are messy and unclear, but still real&mdash;maybe
speculative design lives in this messy middle space.

One way that I think art and design really can be different is that today it's
common for designers to describe their work as way to solve problems&mdash;any
problems. This makes artists seem pretty humble in comparison. I like Victor
Papanek's quote that "there are professions more harmful than industrial
design, but only a few," and when I discovered speculative design (and
especially its relative, critical design) I thought it might be a way to do
design work in a more self-critical way. I don't think it necessarily does
this, but I do think it's a good way to approach it.

As a topic, climate change is humbling. If designers want to describe
themselves as problem solvers it's fine, but in the context of really difficult
problems I think they shouldn't oversell what they do. At the same time, I feel
that it would be wrong for people to not explore how their respective fields
might respond to climate. These problems seem big enough that everyone should
at least try, in whatever way they can. 

## Processing current events in the group

If I had to characterize this year's reading group I would say that they were
contemplative, with participants listening carefully and leaving space for each
other to talk and to think about each other's comments. When it comes to
facilitating the actual discussions in the group, I lean heavily on my
co-facilitator. Renee is skilled at listening carefully, improvising in
conversation, and gently nudging people when it makes sense. In this case it
was so interesting to see the dynamics of the group develop, and I was really
very happy to be a part of it. I hope we're creating an environment where
people can figure out what their individual responses are.

Especially this year, there were challenges to deal with. For our first group
we considered allowing remote access; because of the pandemic, this group
absolutely had to be virtual. I was also happy that people kept showing up for
what could have felt like yet another Zoom meeting. The group was a place where
we could share feelings about what was happening in the world; even if it was
me expressing the uneasy thankfulness I felt at so easily transitioning to
working remote. 

Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Tony McDade, Dominique Fells, Riah Milton and
Jacob Blake were just a few of the Black people whose deaths were racially
motivated in the months leading up to our group. Protests about violence
against Black people inspired a lot of white people, me included, to look more
closely at ways we're benefitting from systemic racism. In the context of the
group, I was trying to figure out how to incorporate material from people who
are Black or Indigenous; when it would be better to let someone else bring that
work up because I wouldn't do it justice; and if I did bring it up, how to do
it in a way that wasn't a kind of intellectual tourism but that was genuinely
respectful. In the context of climate change I think it's important to consider
issues like these because the negative effects of climate will
disproportionately effect people who are Black or Indigenous. It's still work
to figure out how to do this, and I don't think speculative design by itself
offers any solutions, but I do think it can be another chance to work on issues
like these if you want it to be. 

This year's group also took place in the weeks leading up to the 2020 election.
Processing current events like Justice Ginsburg's death became an important
part of what we did every week. With a president who was exceptionally skilled
at controlling the news cycle, the news just kept coming no matter what, and
deciding to bring things up or how to talk about them became another problem
for us to work on. In this case I think speculative design gave us a way to
process current events. I found that focusing on possible futures gave me a
perspective on what was happening each week that I appreciated. I think that
figuring out how to balance that sharper appreciation of the present against
considering possible futures that we might not expect is going to be an
important next step.

Climate can be an overwhelming topic. Renee and I think about when to sit with
the uncomfortable-ness of it and when to give people a break. This year we ran
one of our sessions as a do-it-yourself film festival, featuring videos from
the design firm Superflux. Everyone dug into examples of their work (see [the
Superflux website](https://superflux.in/#) and [their page on
Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/superflux) for examples.) They selected videos, signed
up for time slots, and then we "screened" the videos together in Zoom and
talked about them. Meanwhile in a breakout room I gave tarot readings to anyone
who wanted one using [Instant
Archetypes](https://superflux.in/index.php/and-now-for-something-completely-different/#),
the Superflux tarot deck. It was fun&mdash;which felt strange, and in the
bigger picture of what we were exploring this strangeness seems worth exploring
too.

## The future as contested territory

The problems that we're looking at may not be possible to "solve", and I'm
critical of the way designers decompose problems and use design methods on them
anyway. (If I'm less critical about art it's probably because I'm more na√Øve
about it, I think never making money doing it helps.)

But I do think that design is one of the fields that people might call on when
they have a problem. If we're going to have something like a Green New Deal
some of those plans for projects are going to use design methods (or God help
us "frameworks") that people use now, and I want to look at them critically.
At the same time a lot of smart, hardworking people who really care work as
designers. I hope I can continue to use the group to meet people (designers,
artists, and others) for these kinds of discussions.

The future is contested territory. I have always liked to think about myself as
a person who appreciates a diversity of ideas&mdash;but in the context of the
future, diversity of ideas isn't enough. Because for many people, an
intellectual curiosity about future possibilities is a luxury they don't have
when they're advocating for futures where they can simply exist. I'm glad to
have the group to bring people together to push each other (me included) to
look at the future from other people's eyes. 

*Thanks so much to my co-facilitator Renee, and to LATITUDE, and to everyone
who has participated in this year's group.*
