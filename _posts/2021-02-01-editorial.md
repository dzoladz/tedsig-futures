<strong>Speculative Library Futures | Post-Pandemic Libraries</strong> is the culmiation of a yearlong exploration of speculative design and libraries by <a href="https://www.alaoweb.org/igs/tedsig/index.html/">TEDSIG</a>, the Technical, Electronic, and Digitial Services Interest Group of the <a href="https://www.alaoweb.org/">Academic Library Association of Ohio</a>.

<div class="teasers">
    <p><a>Speculative Card Deck</a> by Mackenzie Salisbury and Shannon Marie Robinson integrates Guy Debord's dérive into a beautifully-designed, critical deck of prompts and actions to generate situations that disrupt the traditional use value assigned to the library.</p>
    <p><a>Notes on a Speculative Design Reading Group</a> by John Jung reflects on the conversations with artists, designers, and librarians that emerged during “Design After the End of the World”, a speculative design reading group at Chicago’s community lab LATITUDE.</p>    
    <p><a>Hair Catalog</a> by Shannon Marie Robinson applies metadata of forensic examination to describe an object, highlighting how traditional metadata, such as title and author, influence discovery and control the development of new knowledges.</p>
    <p><a>Alternative Art History</a> by Shannon Marie Robinson reconfigures the relations between archival memory, meaning-making, and how we query knowledge, by shifting away from the dominant perspective of the author and towards the preservation of scholarly communication between readers.</p>
    <p><a>Tech to You</a> by Myiesha Speight and Bria Sinnott accepts the disintegration of the library as a physical place to explore fundamental questions about the qualifications of librarianship and the definition of impactful public services.</p>    
    <p><a>Growing Through the Cracks</a> by Heidi Beke-Harrigan and Katie DeJongh asks us to accept stillness as a mode of generative thought, one that encourages optimistic and parallel futures to sprout from a nurturing and reciprocal dialogue between image and haiku.</p>
    <p><a>Alexandr.ia</a> by Calvin Cleary and Liz Lang is a dystopian look at the future of precarity in academic libraries, which takes the form of a satirical pitch to Silicon Valley investors for an app called Alexandr.ia.</p>

## Background

The origin of this work finds its roots in a Holiday Inn, immediately off of exit 50, on southbound interstate 70, of an oddly remote conference center. It was the late afternoon, in October (foggy) of was 2016 in Wilmington, Ohio. I was listening to a presentation from [John Jung](https://johnjung.us/) and [Kathy Zadrozny](https://kzadrozny.com/), both from the University of Chicago, about the use of an element of design fiction - the creation of believable near-future stories - to explore the social, cultural and ethical aspects of technological change. The presentation made a deep and lasting impression on me. I continued to think about it for years.

When I became co-chair of TEDSIG in July of 2018, taking the interest group in a fresh direction was an intention decision. Rather than continue to faciliate workshops and other learning opportunities that focused on the day-to-dat tooling that enables technical services library work, I wanted to use this opporunity to reinvigate our field from first principles. Using the premise that many of our existing library systems are reaching the limits of their effectiveness, consider alternative futures. To avoid a future that merely recapitulates - both the positive and negative aspects of - our present solutions, we need to think critically about the design of our future.

Invited John Jung to present an hour-long exploration of Speculative/Critical Design and Libraries at [TEDSIG 2020](https://tedsig.alaoweb.org/).Where traditional design attempts to solve problems, speculative design attempts to open our minds to new ways of thinking and being. If it is our capacity to envision the future that propels us forward, speculative design has promise as a way to allow us to problematize our present, so as not to repeat our past, by exposing the pre-existing conditions of our current reality.

Attendees of TEDSIG 2020 were invited to continue the exploration by participating in a 8-week reading group beginning in Spetmer 2020. [Design After the End of the World](https://dzoladz.github.io/2020-reading-group/) Speculative Design and Climate Reading Group co-facilitated by [Renee Albrecht-Mallinger](http://www.reneelynn.com/) and John Jung through [LATITUDE \| Chicago](https://www.latitudechicago.org/). The next step was a call for proposals seeks submissions for a web-based publication. The resulting contributions are included here and similar to walking through a curated exhibit at an art gallery, where each contribution stands on its own as a work of art, but together, create an object for reflecting upon our present-day library and information practices.
