My first contact with Speculative Design was in 2016?, in Wilmington, Ohio... in an oddly remote, large scale conference famility immeditately of the exit # , south interstate 70, in the late afternoon.

Academic Library Association of Ohio's annual conference

a deep and lasting impression was made.

I continued to think about this presentation for years.

Using Design Fiction to Explore Near-Future User Experiences in Libraries
John Jung and Kathy Zadrozny (University of Chicago)
Design fiction is a method that, similar to science fiction, uses storytelling to explore the social, cultural and ethical aspects of technological change. In this workshop we will investigate how design fiction might help libraries respond to change by creating believable near-future scenarios.

[TEDSIG 2020](https://tedsig.alaoweb.org/): Speculative and Critical Design and Libraries

Thomas Moynihan once noted: "We perceive the world as anticipations of its future". If nothing else, this statement gives us pause. Just enough of a delay to remove us from immediacy. Allowing us to bring our set of expectations and assumptions to the foreground and reflect upon how these projections of a near-term reality guide our decision-making in the present. As many of our existing library systems are reaching the limits of their effectiveness, the struggle is real. To avoid a future that merely recapitulates - both the positive and negative aspects of - our present solutions, we need to think critically about the design of our future. But maybe more so, we need a toolkit to problematize our present. To shake loose our assumptions, and provide just enough distance to consider alternatives.

That's where Speculative Design is useful. Where traditional design attempts to solve problems, speculative design attempts to open our minds to new ways of thinking and being. If it is our capacity to envision the future that propels us forward, speculative design has promise as a way to allow us to problematize our present, so as not to repeat our past, by exposing the pre-existing conditions of our current reality.

Call for proposals

We might consider post-pandemic libraries to be behind us, or immediately facing us; or, perhaps they’re far beyond any near-term horizon. Remote, distant, or extending through centuries into a yet-unimagined future. ‘Post-pandemic’ is an intentionally nebulous frame of reference, affording almost instantaneous, molecular futures, while simultaneously opening a fissure in contemporary reality: an opportunity for the as-of-yet-unthought-of to be released unto the world.
