We might consider post-pandemic libraries to be behind us, or immediately facing us; or, perhaps they're far beyond any near-term horizon. Remote, distant, or extending through centuries into a yet-unimagined future. 'Post-pandemic' is an intentionally nebulous frame of reference, affording almost instantaneous, molecular futures, while simultaneously opening a fissure in contemporary reality: an opportunity for the as-of-yet-unthought-of to be released unto the world.

### Further Explanation of this Project
This work is the apotheosis of a yearlong exploration of speculative design and libraries. Beginning with TEDSIG 2020 <sup><a href="#cites">2</a></sup> in July of 2020, continued through an inspired Speculative Design and Climate Reading Group <sup><a href="#cites">3</a></sup> with <a href="https://www.latitudechicago.org/" target="_blank">LATITUDE | Chicago</a>, and culminating with the publication of this object on speculative library futures.
